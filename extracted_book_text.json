Diogenes L Antille\n11 INTRODUCTION\nThe agrifood chain consumes about one third of the world s energy production with about 12\nfor crop production and nearly 80 for processing distribution retail preparation and cookingFig 11 FAO 2011b The agrifood chain also accounts for 8090 of total global freshwateruse Hoff 2011 where 70 is for irrigation alone Additionally on a global scale freshwaterproduction consumes nearly 15 of the entire energy production IEA 2012 It can therefore beargued that making agriculture and the agrifood supply chain independent from fossil fuel usehas huge potential to contribute to global food security and climate protection not only for the nextdecades but also for the coming century Provision of secure accessible and environmentallysustainable supplies of water energy and food must thus be a priority\nOne of the major objectives of the world s scientists farmers decisionmakers and industrialists\nis to overcome the present dependence on fossil fuels in the agrifood sector This dependencyincreases the volatility of food prices and affects economic access to sustenance For exampleFigure 12 shows the close interrelationship between the crude oil price index and the cerealsprice index An increasing energy demand for cultivation is particularly important in regions\nFigure 11 Direct and indirect energy inputs in the food sector FAO 2011b\n1Bundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 2\n2J Bundschuh et al\nFigure 12 Dependence of fossil fuel price index and the cereal price index for the period 20002013\nIRENA 2015 based on FAO Food Price Index and BP Statistics Review of World Energybase 2000 100\nwith expanding irrigated agriculture using pumped water This translates to a foodrelated risk to\nenergy security\nThe development and commercialization of renewable energy sources such as solar wind\nand geothermal provides great potential to reduce costs in the agrifood sector For instance inaddition to power generation the main uses of geothermal waters are for space heating districtheating spas balneology aquaculture and greenhouse heating Lund and Boyd 2015 Howevermuch work remains to be done to make better use of renewable energy in the agrifood sector\nThe aim of this introductory chapter is to critically review recent developments in solar wind\nand geothermal energy applications in agriculture and the agrifood sector such as processingdistribution retail preparation and cooking\n12 ENERGY DEMANDS IN AGRICULTURE\n121 Energy use in agriculture\nAgriculture and food systems rely on a variety of energy sources including renewable and non\nrenewable resourcessuch as fossil fuelsas well as human and animal labor At present fossilfuels in their various forms supply most of the energy required by agriculture that feeds theworld Maraseni et al 2015 Food production is an increasingly energydemanding sector and isneeded in all stages of the agrifood chain In many cases energy costs may represent a significantproportion of the total agricultural production input cost including the price of irrigation as wellas the outlay of manufacturing and transportation of various chemicals and fertilizers\nEnergy is used both onfarm and offfarm It can be further divided into direct energy used\nie the fuel and electricity consumed and the indirect energy embodied energy involved in themanufacturing of all other inputs such as equipment and agrochemicals Chen et al 2010Direct energy may be consumed in three major forms on farms i general electricity usagefor lighting appliances irrigation ii fuel use for machinery tractors and vehicles and iiiheatingcooling for industries such as dairy horticulture piggeries and poultry In field cropsirrigation energy may account for up to 85 of total direct energy use Maraseni et al 2015\nWith the new technologies currently under development Renewable Energy RE with its rapidly\nfalling costs is being increasingly employed in agriculture\n122 The energy management process\nEnergy audits are a crucial part of farm energy management Chen and Baillie 2009a This type\nof audit refers to the systematic examination of a farm facility or site to determine whether and toBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 3\nSolar wind and geothermal energy applications in agriculture back to the future 3\nwhat extent it has used energy efficiently An energy review determines how efficiently it is being\nused It also identifies energy costsaving opportunities and highlights potential improvementsin productivity and quality An energy check may also assess potential savings through strategiessuch as fuel switching tariff negotiation and demandside management eg by changing toalternative farming systems and farm layouts An energy assessment may be undertaken as partof a broader plan to manage production inputs onfarm Chen and Baillie 2009a The objectivesof energy audits include\nConserve energy inputs\nReduce greenhouse gas emissions\nAchieve operational and cost efficiencies with improved productivity and profitability\nExtensive research has been conducted on both energy use and conservation in agriculture\nRecent results of energy efficiency programs have shown considerable variation in energy usebetween different crops as well as different farms of similar production systems Chen et al 2015Pellizzi et al 1988 found that in Europe the range of field energy consumption for wheatlikecereals varied from 2543 GJ ha\n1 For cotton a study by Chen and Baillie 2009b showed that\nthe direct energy inputs for cotton production in Australia ranged from 37152 GJ ha1 Diesel\nenergy inputs ranged from 95365 L ha1 with most farms using between 120180 L ha1D r y\nland cotton was at the lower end of this range The direct onfarm energy use of some nurseriesmay be up to 20000 GJ ha\n1Chen et al 2015\n13 THE WATERENERGY FOODCLIMATE NEXUS\nAgricultural productivity largely depends on the availability of water energy and land resources\nIn the past the agriculture sector enjoyed increasing productivity and was thus able to feed thegrowing world population For example in 2016 the world cereal production was 2526 Mt million metric tons compared with 2000 Mt in 2006 FAO 2016 However the agriculture industryin the 21st century faces numerous challenges It must feed a rapidly increasing population witha depleting availability of resources FAO 2013 Haddeland et al 2014 At the same time itneeds to adapt to a changing climate and reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions Kulak et al2013 Therefore acclimatizing to climate transformation and the necessity to increase agricultural productivity with minimum use of these resources is a major requirement of the 21st centuryJackson et al 2010\nIt can be argued that the irrigation industry is a significant contributor to the global economy\nHowever the industry is currently under pressure to cut water use as an adaptation to a reductionin water availability owing to climate variability and change and competition from other sectorsincluding demands for environmental water Ward et al 2006 The conversion of less efficientflood irrigation systems to more efficient pressurized irrigation systems has been heralded asone way of increasing water use efficiency and creating water savings Mushtaq et al 2013However pressurized irrigation systems may alter patterns of onfarm energy consumption andmay increase cropping intensity More intensive land use might involve more fuel farm machineryand agrochemicals and the production packaging transportation and application of these alsorequires significant energy resources leading to an increase in GHG emissions Maraseni andCockfield 2011ab 2012 Maraseni et al 2012a 2012b\nThis suggests that there is a potential conflict in terms of mitigation and adaptation policies\nand thus warrants a comprehensive and robust investigation There is very little research inthis important policy area Topak et al 2005 and Baillie 2009 have compared the energyconsumption of various irrigation systems but these studies failed to provide a complete picture asthey did not analyze soil carbon GHG emissions associated with the use of primary farm inputsor water consumption and GHG implications of more intensive cropping systems SimilarlyMaraseni et al 2012a 2012b tried to assess GHGs and water saving implications of convertingflood irrigation systems into pressurized irrigation systems through five case studies three cottonBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 4\n4J Bundschuh et al\none lettuce and one lucerne in southern Queensland Australia Y et these studies considered only\none crop and did not assess all crops in a rotation Even within the same irrigation technologythe level of farm inputs ie fuels agrochemicals machinery and thus the energy consumptionand GHG emissions due to production consumption and use of those farm inputs could varysignificantly between crops in a rotation A farmer may employ more agrochemicals in a firstcrop with the intention to use less in the following crop Therefore comprehensive studies ofwater and energy consumption across full cropping rotations covering a wide geographical areaare necessary\n14 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CARBON FOOTPRINT OF AGRICULTURE\n141 Sources of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture\nAgriculture and food systems play an important role in climate change because of their significant\nenergy use and also as a potential source for RE such as bioethanol and biodiesel Overall themain sources of emissions in agricultural production are Chen et al 2010\nEmissions from energy used to power various machinery and processes which may include\nboth the onfarm and postfarm activities\nEmissions from energy used to produce agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides\nie prefarm\nDirect soil emissions or sequestration in soil onfarm\nSoil nitrous oxide N\n2O emissions from the application of nitrogen fertilizer and manures\nonfarm\nMethane CH 4 emissions from prolonged waterlogging or from the digestion systems of\nlivestock onfarm\nWith current technology burning one liter of petrol or diesel would on average emit 23 and\n27 kg CO 2 respectively It is also noted that for the same power output greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom electricity would vary considerably if different fuels were used to generate it Furthermore itis estimated that with the current manufacturing technology the production of one kg of nitrogenfertilizer would require the energy input equivalent to 152 kg of fuel while 1 kg of pesticideswould require the energy input equivalent to up to 5 kg of fuel\nFinally carbon emissions  sequestration in soil as well as soil nitrous oxide N\n2O emissions\nfrom the application of nitrogen fertilizer and manure are also more difficult and expensiveto measure accurately because their annual fluxes are often small variable and distributed overlarge areas Methane and N\n2O have global warming potentials 25 and 298 times that of CO 2\nrespectively over a 100year time period IPCC 2007\n142 Overview of global agricultural emissions\nThere were approximately 501 GtCO 2e greenhouse gas GHG emissions from anthropogenic\nsources in 2010 IPCC 2014 Agriculture shares about 11 of these emissions Tubiello et al2015 This percentage relates to direct sources only If emissions from indirect sources are considered a further 36 of global emissions Vermuelen et al 2012 are accounted forApproximately60 of all N\n2O and 50 of all CH 4emissions originate in the agricultural sector Smith et al\n2007\nSimilarly about 38 of direct agricultural emissions are attributed to N 2O from soils 32\nto CH 4from ruminants 12 to biomass burning 11 to CH 4from rice production and 7 to\nmanure management Bellarby et al 2008 There is evidence of an upsurge in GHG emissionswith rising farm inputs due to growing mechanization and modernization Graham and Williams2003 Maraseni 2007 Maraseni and Cockfield 2011a Mushtaq et al 2013 For exampleduring the period 19902005 global agriculture emissions increased by 14 an average rate ofBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 5\nSolar wind and geothermal energy applications in agriculture back to the future 5\n49 MtCO 2e year1USEPA 2006 Therefore meeting the proposed 2C climate stabilization\ntarget is not possible without reducing agrarian discharges\nAgricultural emission from developing countries is much higher than that of developed nations\nFor example in 2005 developing countries were responsible for 74 of global agriculturalemissions whereas developed states were accountable for only 26 Smith et al 2007 Theproportional contribution of agricultural emissions for developing countries has been increasingfaster due to rapid increases in farm inputs to feed growing populations with limited farmingareas Tubiello et al 2015 Therefore without developing countries shouldering responsibilitya reduction in global agricultural emissions is not possible\nFAO 2014 predicts that there will be over 9 billion people globally by 2050 In order to\nfeed them agricultural production should increase by 60 by 2050 About 80 of the yield risewill come from intensification ie higher yields with more fertilizer pesticide and water inputsmultiple cropping shorter fallow periods and improved seed varieties and another 20 willcome from extensification Johnson et al 2014 The ratio will be 7030 in developing countriesBoth these intensification and extensification processes will increase the share of agriculturalemissions However research by Johnson et al 2014 showed that the selective extensificationof agriculture could save some 22 GtCO\n2e emissions by 2050 compared with a businessasusual\napproach Consequently a wise landuse planning and coordinated approach between governmentdepartments is necessary for reducing agricultural emissions\n143 Life cycle assessment LCA\nTo achieve sustainable development the first step would be to understand and identify where the\nenvironmental impacts and damages actually occur so that targeted remedy actions can be taken\nTo determine the carbon footprint of agricultural products it is necessary to identify and consider\nthe full life cycle of the products from growing to harvesting as well as their waste managementand finally disposal or recycling of the packaging Klpffer 2012 Life cycle assessment LCAis a cradle to grave analysis It examines a system performance starting with the extraction ofraw materials from the earth followed by the operations until the final disposal of the materialas waste This provides the knowledge of how much energy and raw materials are used at eachstage of the product life and how much different types of waste are generated LCA thus helpsto analyze the process involved and allows the consumer more information on the choices of theproduct In particular compared with other methods LCA analysis has the advantage of being ableto quantify the magnitude of the potential environmental saving in each environmental categoryand to avoid the pitfall of just shifting the environmental impacts from one category to another AnLCA project should comply with the international standards ISO 1404014044 Klpffer 2012\nGenerally an LCA analysis consists of the following four steps\nInitiation goal and scope definition project planning\nInventory analysis data collection identifying all relevant input and output items\nImpact assessment analysis quantification and evaluation of impacts on ecosystems human\nbeings and resources use\nInterpretation and improvement assessment sensitivity study evaluation of options to reduce\nenvironmental loads\nOverall LCA is often a computerbased dataintensive operation It requires time skill a large\namount of data and software to manipulate the data Particularly industry and region specificLife Cycle Inventory LCI is essential to undertake a proper LCA project as differences inthe input data as well as project methodologies can significantly affect results and lead to highlyvariable conclusions Furthermore international standardization is likewise necessary Roy et al2009 Decision support tools for best practices and most costeffective designs and managementmust be developed In addition to energy and greenhouse gas emissions the quantification ofthe impacts of water and land footprints and the effects of pesticides and biodiversity are alsoreceiving increasing attentionBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 6\n6J Bundschuh et al\n144 Comparison of environmental impact of different foods\nLCA has now been widely used for process improvements and optimization including in agri\nculture and in the food industry Roy et al 2009 Chen et al 2010 For example it has beenestimated that to produce 1 kg of grain in Australia overall 01 kg of fuel may be consumed and03 kg of greenhouse gases emitted However the total emissions can be significantly influencedby the management and operation methods used and also the product types Biswas et al 2010showed that the life cycle GHG emissions for 1 kg of wool is significantly higher than that forwheat and sheep meat It was also identified that the onfarm stage contributed the most significant portion of total GHG emissions from the production of wheat sheep meat and wool It wasfurther established that CH\n4emissions from enteric methane production and from the decompo\nsition of manure accounted for a significant portion of the total emissions from subclover andmixed pasture production while N\n2O emissions from the soil under wheat production have been\nfound to be the major source of GHG emissions Use of RE may also have a significant benefit\nWith the advent of ecolabeling LCA is being increasingly used as a reporting mechanism It has\nbeen however argued by some that carbon labeling may also have unintended consequences asa green barrier for international trade\n15 MERGING RENEWABLES WITH AGRICULTURE\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH\nA way to overcome the present dependence on fossil fuels is the integration of energy efficiency\nand particularly RE the prices of which aredue to improved technologies but especially due toincreasing mass productioncontinuously decreasing into the agrifood chain sectors Substituting fossil fuel energy resources with renewables becomes progressively important as agriculturalintensity is always growing ie increasing mechanization expansion of irrigated land fertilizerproduction and transportation require more and more energy IRENA 2015 Overcoming risksof future fossil fuel availability fluctuating pricesoften making them unavailable for the poorand their contribution to global warming requires a decoupling of the agricultural sector fromfossil fuels This can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency and the introduction of Renewable Energy Sources RES providing mechanical energy heat and electricity as outlined in theFAO EnergySmart Food Program FAO 2011a Fig 13 Integration of RES especially if theyare available locally into the food chain ie integrated foodenergy systems can directly savethe farmers money but most importantly it can indirectly significantly contribute to creation oflocal development by creating jobs poverty reduction improved gender equity and food securityand at the same time contribute to global food security and global climate protection Renewable energy can be used either directly onsite or indirectly integrating RE into the existingconventional energy supply chain Fig 14\n151 Solar photovoltaic energy applications\nSolar energy in the form of photovoltaic PVproduced electricity can supply andor supplement\nmany energy requirements both on the farm and the entire agrifood chain All that is now poweredby electricity produced from fossil fuels can be adapted to be powered by PV modules These canbe gridconnected PV systems which allow the farmers to sell their notused solar power to theelectricity utility or a standalone system which if electricity is continuously used for a specificprocess needs a storage system as solar is an intermittent available energy source However manyelectricitydriven processes can be performed during the day when solar power is available suchas water pumping and shearing of sheep Depending on the distance to the grid and its voltagePV systems could be much cheaper and of less maintenance needs in remote areas than installingpower lines for connecting to the grid which further may include the need of installing step downtransformers Solar PV applications in agriculture are comprised of i remote electricity supplyBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 7\nSolar wind and

presently powered\nby electricity produced from fossil fuels\n1511 Water pumping\nIn agriculture and the agrifood chain in general PV can be employed for water pumping indifferent applications Pumping from groundwater and surface water bodies is a principal energyconsumer and therefore a principal target for implementing RE technologies to substitute theelectricity produced from the fossil fuels and diesel fuel commonly used for water pumping\nEven though solar water pumping is no noveltyit has existed since the early 1980sit is not\nuntil recent decades that it has been accepted as an easytoinstall sustainable solution for differentscales and for being environmentally friendly Reasons for this were technical improvements butespecially the mass production of solar panels and their respective price drop Varardi 2014Bundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 8\n8J Bundschuh et al\nTable 11 Global use of geothermal heat in agriculture by application category after Lund and Boyd

PV water pumping systems are very reliable and generally\nthe most costeffective solution in locations where the electricity grid is nonexistent or far awayin these areas it has when compared to dieselpowered pumps the additional benefit of muchless maintenance needs compared to the diesel option\nIn Chapter 9 of this book solar water pumping is described in more detail and compared with\ndiesel and gridelectricitypowered pumping in regard to its technical setup and suitability fordifferent situations eg economic social geographic hydrogeological and case studies withexperiences from USA New Y ork state NYSERDA 2005 India Casey 2013 GIZ 2013IRENA 2015 and Morocco Lorentz GmbH 2013 IFC 2014 are presented\n152 Solar and geothermal direct heat applications\nSince solar and geothermal heat can be generally used for the same applications they will be\ndiscussed together Solar and geothermal heat can be employed for i heatingcooling of spacesbuildings soil and water including water for aquaculture ii drying of crops and grains and iiiheating of greenhouses The use of geothermal energy which is a constant heat source available24 hours a day 365 days a year is often underestimated The fact that this resource is practically limitless and renewable together within contrast to the solar optionits independenceof changing climate and weather conditions presents clear advantages in favor of its extendedutilization Irrespective of the obvious climate protection benefits the direct and indirect development of these resources for heating agriculture and horticulture should also respect otherelements of the natural environment Tomaszewska et al 2016 Table 11 shows global installedthermal capacities thermal energy utilization and capacity factors for different applications inagriculture and the agrifood chain using geothermal resources and their change from 19952015Integrated configurations for using geothermal heat for multiple use applications are presentedseparately in Section 155\n1521 Heatingcooling of spaces buildings soil and water\nSpace heating but also cooling using heat in mechanical or evaporative cooling cycles is animportant energy consumer in many applications especially in pig and poultry production whichis mostly carried out in closed buildings and thus requires constant temperature and air qualityconditions for the animals wellbeing to optimize growth Much energy is needed for replacingcontaminated moisture gases odor dust etc indoor air through ventilation and heating A largepart of this energy can be covered by RE using eg solar or geothermal heatdriven airspaceheaterscoolersdehumidifier\nHeating and cooling of water but also milk and agricultural products for use in the agrifood\nchain is energyintensive and an economic burden especially in developing countries and areasBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 9\nSolar wind and geothermal energy applications in agriculture back to the future 9\nFigure 15 Thermal solar water heating costs compared to conventional heating IEA 2014\nwhich are remote from electric power plants as many agricultural areas are which leads to further\ndistribution losses in the electricity grid Locally available RES such as solar and geothermal areeconomically and environmentally sustainable energy sources that are increasingly used to replacefossil fuels through electricity orwherever possible as it has in many cases lower costdirectlyto heat water An example of high energy demands are commercial dairy farms where solar heatis used to heat water for cleaning equipment warming and stimulating the cows udders but alsofor cooling milk these processes account for up to 40 of farms total energy demand IRENA2015 Considering all applications the global capacity of solar water heating increased from65 GWt gigawattsthermal in 2000 to 326 GWt in 2013 REN21 2014 Considering furthertechnological improvements and increasing mass production will result in a further increase inmany areas including different applications in the agrifood chain where water heating is required\nAs Figure 15 shows water heating costs derived from different applications expand over large\nranges and can economically compete with those using fossil fuels either directly or throughelectricity for water heating The same can be expected from applications within the agrifoodchain industries\n1522 Drying of crops fruits grains and animal products\nThere are many options for using heat from sun and geothermal sources for drying crops and\ngrain ranging from very simple and cheap to sophisticated and expensive The sun has beenemployed for thousands of years for drying crops directly on the field or drying fruits on or inspecial devices after being harvested Today s industrialscale demands require generally fast anduniform drying to obtain high quality products suitable for the world market however for local orregional markets in particular in developing countries less sophisticated cheaper drying designsare often more suitable\nWhere geothermal sources are naturally available and accessible at shallow depth springs\netc geothermal drying is an excellent option In contrast to solar geothermal drying is alsosuitable in areas with little solar radiation such as colder climates Fifteen countries report theuse of geothermal energy for drying various grains milk vegetables and fruit crops Examplesinclude seaweed Iceland Ragnarsson 2015 onions USA Boyd et al 2015 wheat and othercereals Serbia Oudech and Djokic 2015 fruit El Salvador Guatemala and Mexico Montalvoand Gutierrez 2015 Lund and Boyd 2015 GutirrezNegrin et al 2015 Lucerne or alfalfaNew Zealand Carey et al 2015 coconut meat Philippines Fronda et al 2015 and

Hungary Lund and Boyd 2015 By theend of 2014 a total of 161 MWt and 2030TJ year\n1were being utilized which is an increase\nof 288 and 242 respectively compared to 2010 Globally 45 thermal energy is used forgreenhouses and open ground heating 20 for aquaculture pond and raceway heating 18 forindustrial process heating and 04 for agricultural drying Lund and Boyd 2015 An example isIceland where geothermal energy has been utilized for about 35 years for drying fish Nowadaysabout 15000 metric tons of cod heads are annually dried using geothermal heat before exportingthem to Nigeria IRENA 2015 Furthermore in Nigeria pyrethrum drying is still being carriedout at a plant constructed in the 1920s near Ebburu estimated at 10 MWt and 10TJ year\n1\nIn Vietnam the drying of bananas coconuts and medicinal herbs occurs using 1183TJ year1\ncapacity at 05 MWt Lund and Boyd 2015\nMost solar dryers are small to middle scale in size Large solar crop driers are in the minority\nas the example of the USA shows the reason seems to be the high cost of the solar collector andsincein contrast to gas dryersdrying rates cannot be controlled IRENA 2015 However itshould be considered that these solar collectors could be used in the nonharvesting period forother purposes reducing the overall costs IRENA 2015 However in hot arid and semiaridclimates smaller sized dryers may not need a sophisticated collector just using the glazed box ofthe system itself and very lowcost dryers can be constructed using simple design and lowcostmaterials such systems are very suitable for drying vegetables fruits and animal products forhome use IRENA 2015\n1523 Heating of greenhouses\nSolar and geothermal heat can be ideal and costeffective energy sources for heating greenhouses\nThe heat can be employed to heat air and soil thus replacing or adapting heaters which are powered\nby fossil fuels or electricity produced from nonrenewable conventional energy resources Therelated costreduction of geothermal or solarheated greenhouses is in particular high in remoteareas without electricity access Hence the geothermal or solar option allows the installation andtheir economic operation in remote areas and production throughout the whole year\nThe leading countries in the use of annual thermal energy being Turkey Russia Hungary\nChina and The Netherlands Lund and Boyd 2015 The main crops grown in greenhousesare vegetables and flowers however tree seedlings USA and fruit such as bananas Icelandare also grown Despite that the numbers with reported geothermal greenhouses decreasedfrom 34 in 2010 to 31 in 2015 the worldwide use of geothermal energy utilized for greenhouses and covered ground heating increased from 2010 to 2015 by 19 in installed capacityand 16 in annual thermal energy use The installed capacity was 1830 MWt and energyuse was 26662TJ year\n1Lund and Boyd 2015 In Turkey greenhouse applications have\nreached 3 million m2612 MWt due to the great success Tomatoes are mostly grown in these\ngreenhouses with the major markets of Russia 60 Europe 20 around 10 elsewhere internationally and the remaining 10 sold domestically Mertoglu et al 2015 Lund and Boyd2015\nIntegrated operation and case studies of greenhouses using RE for geothermal and solar green\nhouse heatingcooling humidification ventilation and water desalination for irrigation will betreated separately in Section 1571 In Chapter 5 of this book the energy usage patterns in thenursery industry in Queensland Australia are examined The opportunities of adopting renewableenergy are also evaluated\n153 Wind power applications\nToday wind energy applications for sole agricultural applications are of reduced importance on\na global scale whereas in the past wind power was used for groundwater pumping Howeverthe mechanical sensitivity and respective maintenance needs of wind wheels today make dieselormuch better where possiblesolar pumping the better option In contrast a combinationBundschuh

electricity\ncompanies or lease the land for installing their largescale wind turbines is an increasing trend asoutlined in Section 154\n154 Multiuse of agricultural land for food and electric power production\nAgricultural areas can be used for multipurpose ie food and energy production where for\nexample solar and wind energy are produced together with agricultural products on the sameland all in all being a winning combination by adding electricity generationa longterm stablesource of incometo the farmers incomes from agricultural production There are differentoptions i the farmers purchase wind turbinessolar panels ii the farmers form windsolarpower cooperatives and iii electricity utilitiesdevelopers installoperate the equipment andmake payments to the farmers according to different criteria such as generated electricity impacton farming activities According to an estimate by the US Department of Energy in the USA windenergy alone could provide 80000 new jobs for rural

Hence suchmultiuse of agricultural land could be very attractive for farmers Cassaday 2003\nThe concept of coproduction of electricity and food was first developed in Japan in 2004\nwhere solar panels were installed in such a way that they did not significantly obstruct agriculturalmanagement such as access of crops to sunlight or movement of agricultural machinery IRENA2015 In a similar way wind turbines can be integrated into farming and grazing areas Anotherinteresting application is the installation of PV panels over irrigation canals to simultaneouslyproduce electricity and reduce evaporative water losses In an example from India a 1 MW solarpower plant was installed over a 750 m length of a canal system In one year it produced 153 GWhof electricity while at the same time hindered the evaporation of about 3300 million of waterwhich can be used for irrigation IRENA 2015 It has been estimated that using the area of a19000 km canal network could save 20 billion liters of water per year IRENA 2015 Such multiuse of agricultural land for food and power production is becoming increasingly more commonIPCC 2011 Multiuse could significantly increase the income for farmers as an example fromGermany proves where 11 of the installed RE capacity is in the ownership of farmers 2012\n155 Agriculture within the cascade system of geothermal direct heat utilization\nWhen

unevenly distributed in space and time energy\nintensive desalination technologies are playing an increasing role in providing water and foodsecurity for future generations At present 70 million m\n3of freshwater are produced each day\nfrom the globally existing 16000 desalination plants IRENA 2015 According to UN Water2014 desalination annually consumes at least 752TWh of electricity which corresponds toabout 04 of global electricity consumption UN Water 2014\nConventional technologies for desalination of salt and brackish water are still limited since\nthey have a high demand for energy which is mostly provided by expensive fossil fuel whereasless than 1 of the desalination capacity depends on renewables IRENA 2012 Energy costsrepresent as much as half of the production cost of desalination plants Herndon 2013 Howeverthe upsurge in desalination capacity and the proportional energy demand rise make further use offossil fuels increasingly economically and environmentally unsustainable A massive shift fromdesalination powered by fossil fuel to REpowered technologies will be essential to meet thegrowing demand for freshwater production by desalination Decoupling freshwater productioncosts from the everincreasing prices of fossil fuels is essential if freshwater is to be provided foragricultural purposes such as irrigation where water is demanded in large

Ghaffour et al 2015concluded that the matching of the desalination process with a renewable energy source RESis technically feasible However the problem lies in continuous versus noncontinuous operationdesalination processes are best suited to continuous operation whereas the principal renewableenergy sources such as wind and solar are noncontinuous Thus matching a desalination systemwith an RES source requires special design and operation which increases complexity and cost\nAt present technological and economic constraints hinder largescale applications Despite that\nrenewables and desalinations as individual technologies are mature and are produced in mass\nGeothermal energy can be an attractive option if lowcost lowenthalpy geothermal sources are\navailable These include geothermal resources at shallow depth water coproduced from onshoreand offshore hydrocarbon wells or from already existing deep wells and residual heat fromgeothermal power plants Bundschuh et al 2015

lowenthalpy geothermal sources Low temperature desalination processes\nhave lower specific energy requirements and a higher thermodynamic efficiency\nOne should notice that geothermal systems not only provide a valuable RES but can also be\nconsidered as the source and solution for freshwater production including irrigation water beingthe main freshwater consumer The desalination of geothermal waters used for energy purposescould be seen as one of the methods for securing high quality water for various purposes In countries with warm climates it is mainly used for the irrigation of agricultural crops Kabay et al2004a 2004b 2009 2013 Koseoglu et al 2010 Tomaszewska et al 2016 Given the increasing deficit of fresh water worldwide the possibilities for desalinating and treating

water as drinking water has additionally enhanced the management of ordinary waterresources Tomaszewska and Szczepa nski 2014 Applications for agriculture can be similarly\ndeveloped\nFreshwater production by REpowered desalination is a technologicalsound option at a small\nor mediumscale and economically viable for water supply in remote areas However upscalingto a large size is still hindered due to the intermittent availability of wind and solar energya disadvantage which geothermal does not have This also suggests the implementation of acombinedcycle solar and geothermal powered desalination process without the need for energystorage Also the development and improvement of innovative desalination technologies whichdo not need continuous operation such as AD and MD and which consequently are more suitablefor RE use can be utilized to overcome this limitation\nOngoing research and development of concentrated solar power CSP based desalination is\nalso promising CSP with

represent an important step towards sustainabledevelopment of such industrial structures since it encourages both business diversification andfull exploitation of internal resources\nThe concept and application of cascade utilization of low and medium enthalpy geothermal\nresources have been described previously in Bujakowski 2007 It can be argued that this is acrucial idea that essentially couples different technologies and applications in order to utilizeall the available geothermal heat by integrating different technologies for electricity generationdistribution and use of thermal energy drying and dehydration processes recreational uses andany other direct use of geothermal heat Fig 115 For greenhouse systems geothermal cascadetechnology can combine electricity production for running pumps and providing lighting alongwith direct heating of the greenhouse RubioMaya et al 2015 presented a comprehensive reviewof different regions around the world employing geothermal resources of medium and lowenthalpyin a cascade manner It is possible that the fluid temperature at the outlet of the generation processhas sufficient thermodynamic quality and can be useful at a sequential process in a second orthird level of temperature Such processes or direct uses are for instance heating systems hotwater supply intermediate drying processes of food or wood and other direct uses of geothermalheat for aquaculture and greenhouses\nFigure 115 is presented in order to describe better the concept of cascade utilization of geother\nmal resource This particular system is a threelevel cascade with electricity production and somethermal applications In this example the geothermal resource of medium enthalpy is utilizedin the first level of the cascade for the production

pumps for heating and cooling themwas not costeffective Furthermore the use of solar photovoltaic cells for power generation wasalso not costeffective particularly when electricity generation in greenhouses was subsidized bythe government On the positive side the decrease of CO\n2emissions due to the use of renewables\nin the greenhouses was considered as an additional benefit\nProfitability analysis data of various applications of renewable energies in greenhouses in\nCreteGreece by V ourdoubas 2015 are presented in Table 16 Direct heating with geothermalfluid was found to be the most profitable The net present value NPV was the highest at 129268In finance the NPV or net present worth NPW is a measurement of the profitability of an undertaking that is calculated by subtracting the present value PV of cash outflows including initialcost from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time Similarly the environmentalbenefits due to the use of renewable energy sources in agricultural greenhouses are presentedin Table 17 Use of the renewable energy systems for heat and power generation in greenhouseswill result in a reduction of greenhouses gases emitted due to energy use in them The reductionswere estimated by V ourdoubas 2015 as the difference of the emissions due to fossil fuels useBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 24\n24 J Bundschuh et al\nminus the emissions due to renewable energy use In the case of using PV cells CO 2emissions\nwere zero when using direct heating with geothermal fluids and heating with solid biomass In thecase of employing a geothermal heat pump the emissions were estimated from the consumptionof grid electricity for the operation of the heat pump\n1572 Closed seawater greenhouses for meeting water energy and food security\nIn contrast to the natural environment where growing conditions may not be optimum for a givencrop glasshouseswhen appropriately managedprovide optimal growth conditions and allyearround operation since parameters such as air temperature relative humidity carbon dioxideconcentration soil temperature and soil moisture can be controlled Cooper and Fuller 1983 Inparticular in arid areas closed seawater greenhouses which use only 10 of the water that openfarming requires for obtaining the same yield Masudi 2014 provide excellent opportunities tosupply food to the domestic market and to produce highpriced export products throughout theyear IRENA 2015\nIf the required solargeothermal sources are available it is a feasible solution for providing\nfood and freshwater to a large part of global inhabitants given the fact that over 70 of thepopulation lives within a distance of less than 70 km ElDessouky and Ettouney 2002 or 80within 100 km Ghaffour 2009 from the seashore\nDue to high freshwater and energy demands solar or geothermal heat can be employed for\nheatingcoolinghumidification and for freshwater production through desalination of saline orbrackish water as well as producing PV energy for other purposes A promising example forsuch a completely solar power operated greenhouse is the Sundrop System which harnessessolar thermal energy to desalinate seawater to produce fresh water for irrigation Saumweber2013 According to Saumweber 2013 the upfront costs of solarbased greenhouses are lowerthan the presentvalue annual cost of fossil fuels for traditional greenhouses in the same locationSaumweber 2013 In Port Augusta Australia a pilot greenhouse was upgraded to a 20hectarefacility with a capacity of producing daily 10000 L desalinated water and more than 15000 t ofvegetables per year WWF and CEEW  2014\nUsing hydroponics that utilize nutrientladen water no fertile soil is required and the facil\nities can also be installed in areas otherwise not suitable for cultivation eg deserts arcticregions Since the nutrients can be welldosed and subsequently the nutrients not consumedby the crops can be reused this eliminates the negative impacts on surface water resourcessuch as eutrophication and contamination of land and water resources which are disadvantagesof conventional agriculture Additionally both aeroponic and hydroponic systems i requiremuch less space and water than conventional farming methods and ii do not require pesticidesto make them a true renewable and sustainable farming system Finally by applying verticalfarming Growing Power 2011 and providing artificial light space demands can be furtherreduced thus making them ideal horticulture systems for cities or small islands The electricity demand of aeroponic and hydroponic cultivations can be provided from renewable energysystems\n158 The present market of renewable energy technologies\nIntegrating RES in agriculture and the wider agrifood chain is a key goal to assuring food security\nand protecting the earth s climate Use of RES for freshwater production is essential since cropirrigation consumes about 70 of all produced freshwater\nRenewable energy technologies suitable for direct agricultural purposes and within the wider\narea of the agrifood chain are mature technologies Mass production has resulted in massiveprice drops and it can be expected that prices will further decrease as the technologies are furtherimproved Solar energy can provide electricity heat and shaft energy wind can provide electricityand shaft energy and geothermal can provide electricity and heat energy Fig 116 For all ofthese RES there exist mature technologies and mature marketsBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 25\nSolar wind and geothermal energy applications in agriculture back to the future 25\nFigure 116 Average annual growth of installed geothermal hydro wind and solar thermal and photo\nvoltaic capacity of the endusers of the power and heating sectors modified from REN212014\n16 CONCLUSIONS\nGlobally the agrifood chain in the world today consumes about onethird of the total global\nenergy production with about 12 for crop production and nearly 80 for postharvest relatedactivities Overall agriculture and agrifood industry is often highly energyintensive particularly in developed countries due to the reliance on fossil fuels that are employed for example forrunning farm equipment generation of electricity for powering fans and pumps and for refrigeration of food supplies Currently conventional fossil fuel sources however are being depletedat a progressively rapid rate not only due to global population growth but also owing to thegrowing energy demands in the agrifood production chain in general The highest share of onfarm energy for instance is required for irrigation by groundwater pumping As a solution to thisproblem the use of locally available renewable energy sources together with energyefficienttechnologies has become increasingly attractive for minimizing the impacts of rising energycosts on agrifood profitability and competitiveness as well as contributing to climate protectionRenewable energy includes solar wind and geothermal sources These renewable energy sourcescan be utilized through a number of wellproven established and new technologies depending onthe sitespecific conditions and needs Such technologies can be either integrated into existingagricultural operations or designed in the planning phase of innovative projects\nOn a global scale a number of successful examples already exist where solar wind and\ngeothermal energy sources have been used either directly or indirectly for electricity generation in agriculture Their economic viability and competitiveness against fossil fuels has beendemonstrated The financial benefits are highest in cases where costly electricity generation bydiesel or petrol generators is replaced by renewable energy sources Furthermore solar or geothermal direct heat applications can be employed for heatingcooling of spaces buildings soil andwater drying of crops and grains and heatingcooling during food processing and ventilation andhumidification of greenhouses In addition multiuse of agricultural land for food and electricpower production also constitutes an attractive way for farmers as it could significantly increasetheir income Another promising option is a cascade system where solarheated water or geothermal water is utilized stepwise for applications requiring temperature gradients For examplefrom a space heating system installation the residual water is cascaded to swimming pools toBundschuh ch001tex 542017 9 16 Page 26\n26 J Bundschuh et al\ngreenhouses andor to aquaculture ponds This maximizes the use of the hot water resource as\nwell as improving the economics Finally the use of solar geothermal and wind energy for waterdesalination has also received considerable attention since it decouples freshwater productionfrom the fossil fuel supply and therefore is an attractive alternative to guarantee future irrigationwater demands and thus improve food security\nDespite these encouraging examples it can be argued that further research is required on the\nimpacts of renewable energy sources on the Life CycleAssessment LCA of agricultural products\nThis is essential in order to profile the economic and environmental performance as well as identify\nthe added improvement opportunities LCA is a particularly pronounced profiling tool for findinghot spots to prioritize action The results of such analyses have been used by industry to validateits environmental efforts allow for informed decisions about product diversification and changeand take advantage of emerging carbon and environmental markets Finally LCAs will help toidentify suitable pathways policy frameworks and convince farmers and other stakeholders ofthe benefits of renewable energy applications in agriculture and the entire agrifood chain Withthese advancements the global agrifood supply chain can be decoupled from its dependency onfossil fuels in order to meet future food demands\nREFERENCES\nAbuJabal MS Kamiya I  Narasaki Y  2001 Proving test for a solarpowered desalination system in\nGazaPalestine Desalination  137 16\nAhmad GE  Schmid J 2002 Feasibility study of
